%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OLD SR530 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Subroutine to compute sound pressure level from voltage data collected
% by the SR530 lockin amplifier.
%	Modified for behavioral systems on 10/13/1999 by BJM

% Program expects a four column calibration data arrays (JJR format):
% These correct for probe, microphone, and amplifier characteristics.
% There should be one such file for each microphone/probe/amplifier
% combination (called MICxxx.CAL).  These data are loaded by subroutine
% GTSPLC() called exterior to this.
%	CDATA(:,1) - frequencies, kHz at which calibration data taken
%	CDATA(:,2) - dB SPL at corresp. cfreq() and cdbvolt() for the
%		microphone and probe tube.
%	CDATA(:,3) - 20*log10(volts rms) from probe microphone in calib.
%		run.
%	CDATA(:,4) - phase correction for probe system.
%	ncdim - number of points in calibration arrays

% With these data, the SPL corresponding to a given RMS voltage rmag from
% the probe microphone can be determined as
%	COMM.SRdata.dbspl = 20*log10(rmag) + CDATA(:,2) - CDATA(:,3)
% RMS voltages are provided to this subroutine in dB form, i.e. as
% 20*log10(rmag).  Note that correction for attenuator settings must be
% done externally.  The calibration file data are expected to be corrected
% to apply at 0 dB attenuation.
%
% The phase correction is applied as below.  Phases are represented
% in units of PI radians (e.g. phase = 0.5 corresponds to 90 degrees).
%	phase = rph + cphase

% Inputs:
%	CDATA calibration arrays as above
%	ndat - number of points in each calibration array
%	iseq - index at which search for frequency freq is started in
%		calibration arrays.
%	ddata(:,1) - frequency of data to convert to SPL, kHz
%	rmag - 20*log10(RMS voltages) to convert
%	rphs - phase of signal, units of PI radians

% Outputs:
%	COMM.SRdata.dbspl() - corrected signal magnitude (may be same as rmag())
%	ophs() - corrected phase (may be same as rphs())
%	error = 0 if O.K.
% 	      = 1 if ddata(:,1). can't be found in calibration array.  In this case,
%		       should not use the current point.
